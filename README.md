# Lethal Warfare 2 v1.1.0
### Adds the Modern Warfare 2 2022 Models to the game

This mods adds multiple models from Call Of Duty Modern Warfare 2 2022 and some functionalities such as tactical spectating.

## Planned Features

More models (it takes a day per model dawg :sobs:)

Change the suit file because lethal doesn't render the model client-side :clown:

Add guns :troll: ?

## Disclaimer
I do not own the models, they are from [Activision, Infinity Ward](https://www.infinityward.com)

## Known Issues
Texture mapping error when spectating a player (library related?)

## Have fun !
